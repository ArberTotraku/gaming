# This is the final project of JavaScript in our course called DCI in Berlin.

## It contains three games where user can choose one that enjoys the most.

1- Casino Game
2- Rock Paper Scissors
3- Russian Roulette

## This project is mostly done by using the javascript function math.random(),where is Javascript the one that decides for us,in few words basically we are "trying" our luck here.

- Readline sync is a way of having an interaction with user and making the games fun.

- I had so much fun working on this project and it was for me a new challenge to myself.
